# WebCubiomes

WebCubiomes is an attempt at bringing the cubiomes-viewer application into a browser. The application can then be clustered across multiple computers, allowing for pointlessly fast speeds.
The first objective is to parse the cubiomes progress file into a vaadin browser application and then create a job system for customized cubiomes-viewer clients.
